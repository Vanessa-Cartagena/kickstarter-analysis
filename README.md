Based on this analysis, Louise would be most successful in creating a play as her theatrical production for the fundraiser as it is the most popular and successful type of campaign. The time of year has shown some correlation in succeeding in a campaign with May and June being the best time of year to start one. Many failed campaigns had high funding so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than Â£4,000.
